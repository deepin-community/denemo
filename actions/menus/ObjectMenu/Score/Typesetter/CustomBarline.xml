        <_tooltip>Create a custom barline.
These can be named, or can simply override a standard LilyPond bar line type.
A bar line is defined by four forms, which describe 1) the appearance normally (during a line), 
2) appearance when the barline is at the beginning or 
3) end of a line , and 
4) what to show when joining staffs together as with a Piano Staff.
Barline forms are made of characters including |,:,.,[,],:
and others in the LilyPond documentation.</_tooltip>
