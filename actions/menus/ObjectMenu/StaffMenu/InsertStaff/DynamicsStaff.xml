        <_tooltip>This line ("staff") is for holding cresc. dim hairpins and dynamic markings so that they can be positioned (using dummy notes, colored blue) and will align with each other.\nCreate this between the staffs for a piano work or on any staff where alignment of hairpins and dynamic marks is needed.
WARNING: Do not start/end staff-groupings on this staff. Do not place clef changes or other non-duration items in this staff - it may trigger the creation of a separate staff on typesetting!
This Dynamics "staff" must have the same part name as the staff the dynamics should appear on.
