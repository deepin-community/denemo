        <_tooltip>Adds a voice whose music is automatically mirrored from another staff of your choice. Use this e.g. to create a staff with two divisi parts, while keeping the second part as a separate staff, or to typeset both Fret Diagrams and Chord Symbols from the same music. Note that initial clef/key/time are copied not mirrored.</_tooltip>
