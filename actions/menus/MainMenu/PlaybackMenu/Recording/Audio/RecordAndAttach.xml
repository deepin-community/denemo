        <_tooltip>The first invocation of this command starts recording - play the melody you want to notate. Then invoke the command again to stop the recording - the audio is attached to an (optional) click track created at the top of the staffs. The recording will play along with your notated music - ensure you have enough filled measures after the cursor to attach the audio to otherwise it won't play.</_tooltip>
