        <_tooltip>Five notes are played at random from the current bar.
You must play the last one on the MIDI keyboard to score. 
You can paste as many different notes as you like into a bar -
if you include the same note many times you will get that one more often.
You can cheat by looking at the Denemo cursor position.
Invoke the command again to stop.</_tooltip>
