.SH SYNOPSIS
.B denemo_file_update
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B denemo_file_update
command.
.PP
\fBGNU denemo\fP is a GUI musical score editor written in C/gtk+.
It is intended primarily as a frontend to GNU Lilypond,
but is adaptable to other computer-music-related purposes as well.
You can compose, transcribe, arrange, listen to the music and much more.
.PP
This command is a wrapper intended to provide an easy way to update
the denemo files created with previous versions of denemo. It looks
for all the files with .denemo extension in the current directory
using the find command, and then executes denemo on each of them to
update the file.
.PP
The full documentation for denemo is kept in html format and can be found at
/usr/share/doc/denemo-doc/denemo-manual.html after you have installed the 
denemo-doc package.
