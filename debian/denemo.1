.SH NAME
denemo \- gtk+ frontend to GNU Lilypond
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B denemo
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B denemo
command.
.PP
\fBGNU denemo\fP is a GUI musical score editor written in C/gtk+.
It is intended primarily as a frontend to GNU Lilypond,
but is adaptable to other computer-music-related purposes as well.
You can compose, transcribe, arrange, listen to the music and much more.
.PP
Denemo itself does not engrave the music for printout - it uses
LilyPond which generates beautiful sheet music to the highest
publishing standards. Denemo just displays the staffs in a slim and
efficient way, so you can enter and edit the music efficiently.
.PP
The word Denemo is a corruption of the French word d√©nouement.
.PP
The full documentation for denemo is kept in html format and can be found at
