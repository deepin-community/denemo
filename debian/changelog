  * Fix FTBFS in 2.4.0-1 by bumping debhelper-compat to level 13

denemo (2.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 2.0.14.
    Among all the improvements, the most notable is most likely the
    new tooltip system that no longer plasters the screen with
    multiple tooltips which block the user from reaching the actual
    interface.  According to upstream author Richard Shann:
       "We have been plagued for some time by changes to Gtk which have
        made tooltips unusable in some builds.
        I've implemented a new tooltip system that won't be affected
        by what Gtk does with its tooltips in future. It works
        somewhat differently (unfortunately): you need to move the
        mouse over the item for the tooltip to pop up. The tooltip
        can be dismissed either by quitting it or by clicking -
        it won't reappear for the same item unless you first move
        off the item and return. So in practice a shake of the mouse
        will remove the tooltip, (in and out of the tip).
        But, best of all the speed with which they pop-up is once again
        controllable."
  * Modify debian/watch to check PGP signature in .sig file.
    Upstream uses .tar.gz.sig rather than .tar.gz.asc for their
    PGP signature files.
  * Add myself to the list of Uploaders.
  * Remove exceptions for s390x, hurd-i386 and ppc64el.
    lilypond, since 2.18.2-7, builds correctly in all these three
    architectures, so we no longer need to skip tests for them.

denemo (1.1.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules
    - dh_auto_test is now disabled in some architectures:

        is required for the tests.
      + s390x the binary is not properly executed without full
        installation which is preventing the tests from proper
        execution in this architecture.
    - GUILE_AUTO_COMPILE variable added in order to disable the guile
      auto-compilation during the tests execution.
  * debian/control
    - lilypond build dependency is now disabled for s390x, hurd-i386, and

    denemo and are only provided in the binary package as documentation, so
    local changes won't have had any effect anyway.

      potential segfaults.
    - print.c: Don't ignore failures from lilypond or tex.

    the fix in 0.5.6-3.
